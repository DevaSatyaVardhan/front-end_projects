 Focused on building an interactive canvas-based game from scratch.

 🧱 Bricks, paddle, and ball – everything coded from scratch.

 🎮 Added scoring, win condition, and responsive UI with Bootstrap.

 🌄 Custom background image for an immersive gaming look.

 🔁 Game stops once all bricks are broken – fully playable!

 🧠 Learned about canvas rendering, collision detection, and game loops.

 📱 It’s responsive and looks great on both desktop and mobile.

 💡 Built with beginner-friendly logic to keep it simple and clean.

 👨‍💻 This was a fun step into creative frontend development!
